# Logistic-Regression

Implemented Logistic Regression without in-built functions on "banks-1.csv" dataset.

The dataset contains information about the financial condition of banks, as well as several financial ratios. The "Financial Condition" column indicates whether a bank is in good (1) or bad (0) financial condition. The other columns contain the following information:

TotCap/Assets: the ratio of total capital to total assets
TotExp/Assets: the ratio of total expenses to total assets
TotLns&Lses/Assets: the ratio of total loans and leases to total assets
These financial ratios can be used as features to predict the financial condition of a bank.
